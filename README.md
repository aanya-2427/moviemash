### About The Project

moviemash is a web application developed for Microsoft Engage 2022. As a part of the program, the mentees were assigned the task to choose a track from the three given tracks. moviemash comes under the third track, Algorithms.In this track we were asked to implement a recommendation engine in the app based on any algorithm of our choice.The main aim of the project is to develop a web application which recommends movies to user based on the movie he  searched at that time with ease of use and simplicity. 

### Salient Features
* User authentication using Firebase 
* Search a movie and get its details like title,genre,runtime,rating,poster
* Recommending movies based on the searched movie at that time

<!-- AGILE METHODOLOGY -->
### Agile Methodology

### What is Agile

Agile is a development methodology adopted today in the software industry. Agile promotes teamwork, flexible procedures, and sle-organizing teams.

### How I Incorporated Agile Methodology During The Development Cycle

SCRUM is a subset of Agile, a framework for developing software. SCRUM takes advantage of different techniques to achieve goals in Agile. SCRUM promotes an iterative model where the planning is performed on a very short term. The basic time working unit is the sprint. SCRUM teams always reason in sprints and their planning is limited to sprints.


* Sprint 1 (May 4-May 8): Sprint Planning, Research and Design - Researching about what is recommendation engine, whar its types, how it works, what are the agorithms that streaming platfroms like Netflix,Spotify use for their recommendation engine.

* Sprint 2( May 8- May 12):Searched about various libraries (if needed) for implementing recommendation agorithm.  After finalizing the algorithm to be used for recommendation ,I searched for tutorials, designed a wireframe including the functionalities I want and designed the UI.Build a basic prototype of the web application.

* Sprint 3 (May 12- May 24): Software development and debugging - Started the development process by taking help from medium blogs, Youtube tutorials. Built a web application after the initial prototype using Python, Flask and HTML,CSS and JS for frontend, Firebase for storage of data. Encountered occasional bugs which I debugged timely. Made required changes in the UI and color scheme to make it more eye pleasing.

* Sprint 4 (May 24-May 27): Debugging and adding additional features. Decided to build the recommendation engine using content-based filtering by using similarity score and cosine similairty which recommends movie based on the movie that user searched at that time.Made required changes to integrate the frontend part. Added sign in authentication using Firebase. Also added sentiment analysis of the user reviews by scrapping them from IMDB site.<hr>
